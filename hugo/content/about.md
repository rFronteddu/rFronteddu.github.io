Hi! My name is Roberto Fronteddu and I am from Longastrino, Italy. Longastrino is a little town in the middle of nowhere. I grew up biking around swamps, serving coffees at my parentsâ€™ bar, eating pizza during the weekend (my father used to be a pizza maker), and playing lots of video games. I figured out I wanted to be a software developer pretty quickly (either that or hobo martial artist) but it took a while before I could get into that. When I was 14, I started high school with the objective of becoming an electronic technician. In those years I also started two of my greatest passions: Karate (funny thing is that I really wanted to do kung-fu but there was no gym in my little village) and Guitar. After highschool I moved to Ferrara and started studying I.T. engineering (basically lots of math and some programming, very Italian style). At the end of my Master I moved to Pensacola, Florida and started my internship at the Florida Institute For Human and Machine Cognition, a company that eventually hired me and still counts me in its workforce. While I work I am also pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at my Italian University.

In my job as a Senior Research Associate, I maintain numerous components written in C++, JAVA, and GO, and recently started branching into JS, Python, and ML. ML is still a minor part but I am trying to figure out how to auto-configure my software to different scenarios. Other tasks that I am normally involved in are supporting new staff and other team members and writing articles and reports about what I achieve.

I have lots of hobbies and things I like to try and pursue. Lately you can find me playing guitar or practicing martial arts and yoga. Recently I started getting very serious in my guitar practice and I joined an online course that I am deeply enjoying. Another thing that I like a lot are video games, I like to play and I am trying to write one in Unity. Finally, I am an avid classic reader and music listener so if you find something really cool, do not hesitate to share it with me!
